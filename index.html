				“Game Semantics for the Constructive \(\mu\)-calculus” at <a href="http://www.lanmr.unam.mx/index.html">15th Latin American Workshop on New Methods of Reasoning</a>
			</summary>

			<p>
				We define a constructive version of the \(\mu\)-calculus by adding least and greatest fixed-point operators to constructive modal logic. We define game semantics for the constructive \(\mu\)-calculus and prove its equivalence to bi-relational Kripke semantics. For applications, we study the logic \(\mu\mathsf{CS5}\), a constructive variation of \(\mathsf{S5}\) with fixed-points operators.

				“Towards a characterization of the \(\mu\)-calculus' collapse to modal logic” at <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/aalogic/aal-conference-2023">Australasian Association for Logic 2023 Conference</a>
			</summary>
			<p>The \(\mu\)-calculus is obtained by adding least and greatest fixed-point operators \(\mu\) and \(\nu\) to modal logic. The alternation depth of a formula measures the entanglement of its least and greatest fixed-point operators. Bradfield showed that, for all \(n\in\mathbb{N}\), there is a formula \(W_n\) such that \(W_n\) has alternation depth \(n\) and, over all Kripke frames, \(W_n\) is not equivalent to any formula with alternation depth smaller than \(n\).</p>

			<p>The same may not happen over restricted classes of frames: Alberucci and Facchini showed that, the \(\mu\)-calculus collapses to modal logic over \(\mathsf{S5}\) frames. That is, every \(\mu\)-formula is equivalent to a formula without fixed point operators over \(\mathsf{S5}\) frames. Later, Pacheco and Tanaka proved that the \(\mu\)-calculus also collapses to the \(\mu\)-calculus over \(\mathsf{S4.4}\) and \(\mathsf{S4.3.2}\) frames. </p>

			<p>We show how Alberucci and Facchini's proof generalize to the \(\mu\)-calculus's collapse over \(n\)-pigeonhole frames. Let \(n\in\omega\). A frame \(F =\langle W,R\rangle\) is an \(n\)-pigeonhole frame iff, for all sequence \(w_0 R^+ w_1 R^+ \cdots R^+ w_n\), there is \(i< j\leq n\) such that \(w_{i}R =  w_{j}R\). We also comment about ongoing work to prove the converse: if the \(\mu\)-calculus collapses to modal logic over a class of frames \(\mathsf{F}\), then there is \(n\in\omega\) such all frames \(F\in\mathsf{F}\) are \(n\)-pigeonhole. </p>

			<p>I will review some recent results on the reverse mathematics of automata on infinite words. This is still a new subarea of reverse mathematics, but it already touches very weak and very strong subsystems of second order arithmetic.

				“The \(\mu\)-calculus’ collapse on variations of \(\mathsf{S5}\)” at <a href="https://lc2023.unimi.it">Logic Colloquium 2023</a>
			</summary>
			<p>
				The \(\mu\)-calculus is obtained by adding to modal logic the least and greatest fixed-point operators \(\mu\) and \(\nu\). The alternation depth of a formula measures the entanglement of its least and greatest fixed-point operators. Bradfield showed that, for all \(n\in\mathbb{N}\), there is a formula \(W_n\) such that \(W_n\) has alternation depth \(n\) and, over all Kripke frames, \(W_n\) is not equivalent to any formula with alternation depth smaller than \(n\).
			<p>
				The same may not happen over restricted classes of frames: Alberucci and Facchini showed that, over frames of \(\mathsf{S5}\), every \(\mu\)-formula is equivalent to a formula without fixed point operators. In this case, we say the \(\mu\)-calculus collapses to modal logic over frames of \(\mathsf{S5}\).
			<p>
				We show how Alberucci and Facchini’s proof generalize to the \(\mu\)-calculus’s collapse over frames of intuitionistic \(\mathsf{S5}\). This generalization can also be done for some non-normal logics and for graded modal logics. We also show that, on the other hand, the \(\mu\)-calculus does not collapse over the bimodal logic \(\mathsf{S5}_2\).

			</summary>
			<p>
				The \(\mu\)-calculus is obtained by adding fixed-point operators to modal logic. Alberucci and Facchini showed that every \(\mu\)-formula is equivalent to some modal formula over frames of \(\mathsf{S5}\). The modal logic \(\mathsf{IS5}\) is an intuitionistic variation of \(\mathsf{S5}\), first defined by Prior in 1957. We show that, with slight changes, Alberucci and Facchini's proof also works in frames of \(\mathsf{IS5}\). That is, every \(\mu\)-formula is equivalent to some modal formula over frames of \(\mathsf{IS5}\). This is joint work with Kazuyuki Tanaka. <a href="./slides/akiu-2022.pdf">Slides.</a>

			<p>
				It is known that the \(\mu\)-calculus collapses to its alternation-free fragment over transitive frames and to modal logic over equivalence relations.
    			We adapt a proof by D'Agostino and Lenzi to show that the \(\mu\)-calculus collapses to its alternation-free fragment over weakly transitive frames.
    			As a consequence, we show that the \(\mu\)-calculus with derivative topological semantics collapses to its alternation-free fragment.
    			We also study the collapse over frames of \(\mathsf{S4.2}\), \(\mathsf{S4.3}\), \(\mathsf{S4.3.2}\), \(\mathsf{S4.4}\) and \(\mathsf{KD45}\), logics important for Epistemic Logic.

				“Determinacy and reflection principles in second-order arithmetic” at <a href="https://wrmp2022.sciencesconf.org">Workshop on Reverse Mathematics and its Philosophy</a> (joint presentation with Keita Yokoyama)
			</summary>
			<p>
				It is well-known that several variations of the axiom of determinacy play important roles in the study of reverse mathematics, and the relation between the hierarchy of determinacy (especially the level of \(\Sigma^0_2\) and \(\Sigma^0_3\)) and comprehension axioms are revealed by Tanaka, Nemoto, Montalbán, Shore, and others. In this talk, we show variations of a result by Kołodziejczyk and Michalewski relating determinacy and reflection in second-order arithmetic based on a model-theoretic characterization of the reflection principles.

			</summary>
			<p>
				Working in second order arithmetic, we characterize determinacy of finite differences of open and \(\Sigma^0_2\) sets as reflection principles. In order to do so we study sequences of coded \(\beta\)-models. More precisely, we prove that: over \(\mathsf{ACA}_0\), \(\Pi^1_2\)-\(\mathsf{Ref}(\mathsf{ACA}_0)\) is equivalent to \(\forall n.(\Sigma^0_1)_n\)-\(\mathsf{Det}^*_0\), and \(\Pi^1_3\)-\(\mathsf{Ref}(\Pi^1_1\)-\(\mathsf{CA}_0)\) is equivalent to \(\forall n.(\Sigma^0_1)_n\)-\(\mathsf{Det}\); over \(\mathsf{ATR}_0\), \(\Pi^1_3\)-\(\mathsf{Ref}(\Pi^1_2\)-\(\mathsf{CA}_0)\) is equivalent to \(\forall n.(\Sigma^0_2)_n\)-\(\mathsf{Det}\).

			<p>
				Epistemic logic is the logic of knowledge, belief and related notions. In this presentation I define and motivate three different modal semantics for epistemic logic: relational semantics, topological semantics and neighborhood semantics. I also comment on the relation between these semantics and common knowledge. I assume no knowledge of modal logic.

				Abstract: It is known that several variations of the axiom of determinacy play important roles in the study of reverse mathematics, and the relation between the hierarchy of determinacy and comprehension are revealed by Tanaka, Nemoto, Montalbán, Shore, and others.

				Abstract: Epistemic Logic normally discourses on knowledge, belief, and related concepts.
				We here study ignorance instead.
				With the help of the \(\mu\)-calculus, we analyze the degrees of ignorance in which an agent doesn't know whether or not a given proposition is true.
				Building on the study by Stalnaker, we argue that logics "closer" to \(\mathsf{S4.2}\) allow greater degrees of ignorance, compared to logics "closer" to \(\mathsf{S5}\). Extended abstract available <a href="http://www.asahi-net.or.jp/~yt6t-ymd/sr22/socreal2022abs.pdf">here</a>.

			</summary>
			<p>
				Abstract: In this paper, we study one-variable fragments of modal \(\mu\)-calculus and their relations to parity games.
				We first introduce the weak modal \(\mu\)-calculus as an extension of the one-variable modal \(\mu\)-calculus.
				We apply weak parity games to show the strictness of the one-variable hierarchy as well as its extension.
				We also consider games with infinitely many priorities and show that their winning positions can be expressed by both \(\Sigma^\mu_2\) and \(\Pi^\mu_2\) formulas with two variables, but requires a transfinite extension of the \(L_\mu\)-formulas to be expressed with only one variable.
				At last, we define the \(\mu\)-arithmetic and show that a set of natural numbers is definable by both a \(\Sigma^\mu_2\) and a \(\Pi^\mu_2\) formula of \(\mu\)-arithmetic if and only if it is definable by a formula of the one-variable transfinite \(\mu\)-arithmetic. <a href="https://doi.org/10.1142/9789811259296_0002">DOI: 10.1142/9789811259296_0002</a>

				<summary>Thesis: Exploring the difference hierarchies on \(\mu\)-calculus and arithmetic — from the point of view of Gale–Stewart games</summary>

				<p>Available <a href="./phd_thesis-Leonardo.pdf">here</a>.</p>

				<p>Short abstract: In this thesis, we study two problems related to difference hierarchies.
				The difference hierarchy for a point class \(\Gamma\) classifies the Boolean combinations of sets in \(\Gamma\) by their complexity.
				Gale–Stewart games play essential roles in both problems.</p>

				<p>In the first part of this thesis, we study the \(\mu\)-calculus' alternation hierarchy over various semantics.
				The \(\mu\)-calculus' alternation hierarchy classifies its formulas by how many interdependent fixed-point operators appear in a given formula.
				Bradfield showed that the alternation hierarchy is strict over arbitrary frames.
				This may not happen if we modify the semantics.</p>

				<p>We refine Alberucci and Facchini's proof of the collapse to modal logic over equivalence relations to show that the alternation hierarchy collapses to modal logic in bigger classes of frames.
				We use this characterization to study degrees of ignorance in various epistemic logics.
				Afterwards, we show that, on graded semantics, constructive semantics and modal logic with impossible worlds, the alternation hierarchy collapses to modal logic over equivalence relations.
				On the other hand, the alternation hierarchy is strict on multimodal \(\mu\)-calculus over equivalence relations.
				We also show that current proofs of the collapse do not work on the non-monotone \(\mu\)-calculus.
				Furthermore, we show that the alternation hierarchy collapses to its alternation-free fragment over weakly transitive frames.</p>

				<p>In the second part of this thesis, we study the connection between Gale–Stewart games and reflection principles in second-order arithmetic.
				Gale–Stewart games have been studied in reverse mathematics since its beginning and are central to descriptive set theory.
				Sets definable by the \(\mu\)-calculus are exactly the winning regions of Gale–Stewart games whose payoffs are Boolean combinations of \(\Sigma^0_2\) sets.</p>

				<p>Kołodziejczyk and Michalewski proved that the determinacy of Boolean combinations of \(\Sigma^0_2\) sets is equivalent to the reflection principle \(\Pi^1_3\)-\(\mathrm{Ref}(\Pi^1_2\)-\(\mathsf{CA}_0)\).
				We use finite sequences of coded \(\beta\)-models to prove that the determinacy of Boolean combinations of \(\Sigma^0_1\) sets is equivalent to the reflection principle \(\Pi^1_3\)-\(\mathrm{Ref}(\Pi^1_1\)-\(\mathsf{CA}_0)\).
				We also use the same method to give a new proof of Kołodziejczyk and Michalewski's result.
				At last, we use a modified version of the method to prove that the determinacy of Boolean combinations of \(\Sigma^0_1\) sets of Cantor space is equivalent to the reflection principle \(\Pi^1_2\)-\(\mathrm{Ref}(\mathsf{ACA}_0)\).</p>
