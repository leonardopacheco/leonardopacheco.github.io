	            Both the intuitionistic propositional calculus \(IPC\) and the modal logic \(S4\) are complete with respect to topological spaces. I will sketch how to combine these their topological semantics to obtain bi-topological semantics for the intuitionistic modal logic \(IS4\). Before that, I will briefly describe the history of topological semantics and \(IS4\). I will also comment on bi-topological semantics for other non-classical variations of \(S4\) and other related ongoing work.

	        <p>
	            The modal \(\mu\)-calculus is obtained by adding least and greatest fixed-point operators to modal logic. It's alternation hierarchy classifies the \(\mu\)-formulas by their alternation depth: a measure of the codependence of their least and greatest fixed-point operators. The \(\mu\)-calculus' alternation hierarchy is strict over the class of all Kripke frames: for all \(n\), there is a \(\mu\)-formula with alternation depth \(n+1\) which is not equivalent to any formula with alternation depth \(n\). This does not always happen if we restrict the semantics. For example, every \(\mu\)-formula is equivalent to a formula without fixed-point operators over \(\mathsf{S5}\) frames. We show that the multimodal \(\mu\)-calculus' alternation hierarchy is strict over non-trivial fusions of modal logics. We also comment on two examples of multimodal logics where the \(\mu\)-calculus collapses to modal logic.

	            Feedback Turing machines are Turing machines which can query a halting oracle which has information on the convergence or divergence of feedback computations. To avoid a contradiction by diagonalization, feedback Turing machines have two ways of not converging: they can diverge as standard Turing machines, or they can freeze. A natural question to ask is: what about feedback Turing machines which can ask if computations of the same type converge, diverge, or freeze? We define \(\alpha\)th order feedback Turing machines for each computable ordinal \(\alpha\).

			</summary>

			<p>
				I will talk about the connection between reflection principles and the existence of sequences of beta-models in second-order arithmetic. The reflection principles are of the form: if a formula is provable in a given system, then they are true. Beta-models are coded models which have the same ordinals as the ground model. I comment on how to use this connection to characterize determinacy axioms in reverse mathematics.

				We define a constructive version of the \(\mu\)-calculus by adding least and greatest fixed-point operators to constructive modal logic.

				‚ÄúTowards a characterization of the \(\mu\)-calculus' collapse to modal logic‚Äù at <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/aalogic/aal-conference-2023">Australasian Association for Logic 2023 Conference</a>
			</summary>
			<p>The \(\mu\)-calculus is obtained by adding least and greatest fixed-point operators \(\mu\) and \(\nu\) to modal logic. The alternation depth of a formula measures the entanglement of its least and greatest fixed-point operators. Bradfield showed that, for all \(n\in\mathbb{N}\), there is a formula \(W_n\) such that \(W_n\) has alternation depth \(n\) and, over all Kripke frames, \(W_n\) is not equivalent to any formula with alternation depth smaller than \(n\).</p>

			<p>The same may not happen over restricted classes of frames: Alberucci and Facchini showed that, the \(\mu\)-calculus collapses to modal logic over \(\mathsf{S5}\) frames. That is, every \(\mu\)-formula is equivalent to a formula without fixed point operators over \(\mathsf{S5}\) frames. Later, Pacheco and Tanaka proved that the \(\mu\)-calculus also collapses to the \(\mu\)-calculus over \(\mathsf{S4.4}\) and \(\mathsf{S4.3.2}\) frames. </p>

			<p>We show how Alberucci and Facchini's proof generalize to the \(\mu\)-calculus's collapse over \(n\)-pigeonhole frames. Let \(n\in\omega\). A frame \(F =\langle W,R\rangle\) is an \(n\)-pigeonhole frame iff, for all sequence \(w_0 R^+ w_1 R^+ \cdots R^+ w_n\), there is \(i< j\leq n\) such that \(w_{i}R =  w_{j}R\). We also comment about ongoing work to prove the converse: if the \(\mu\)-calculus collapses to modal logic over a class of frames \(\mathsf{F}\), then there is \(n\in\omega\) such all frames \(F\in\mathsf{F}\) are \(n\)-pigeonhole. </p>

			</summary>
			<p>
				The \(\mu\)-calculus is obtained by adding to modal logic the least and greatest fixed-point operators \(\mu\) and \(\nu\). The alternation depth of a formula measures the entanglement of its least and greatest fixed-point operators. Bradfield showed that, for all \(n\in\mathbb{N}\), there is a formula \(W_n\) such that \(W_n\) has alternation depth \(n\) and, over all Kripke frames, \(W_n\) is not equivalent to any formula with alternation depth smaller than \(n\).
			<p>
				The same may not happen over restricted classes of frames: Alberucci and Facchini showed that, over frames of \(\mathsf{S5}\), every \(\mu\)-formula is equivalent to a formula without fixed point operators. In this case, we say the \(\mu\)-calculus collapses to modal logic over frames of \(\mathsf{S5}\).
			<p>
				We show how Alberucci and Facchini‚Äôs proof generalize to the \(\mu\)-calculus‚Äôs collapse over frames of intuitionistic \(\mathsf{S5}\). This generalization can also be done for some non-normal logics and for graded modal logics. We also show that, on the other hand, the \(\mu\)-calculus does not collapse over the bimodal logic \(\mathsf{S5}_2\).

			</summary>
			<p>
				It is known that the \(\mu\)-calculus collapses to its alternation-free fragment over transitive frames and to modal logic over equivalence relations.
    			We adapt a proof by D'Agostino and Lenzi to show that the \(\mu\)-calculus collapses to its alternation-free fragment over weakly transitive frames.
    			As a consequence, we show that the \(\mu\)-calculus with derivative topological semantics collapses to its alternation-free fragment.
    			We also study the collapse over frames of \(\mathsf{S4.2}\), \(\mathsf{S4.3}\), \(\mathsf{S4.3.2}\), \(\mathsf{S4.4}\) and \(\mathsf{KD45}\), logics important for Epistemic Logic.
    			At last, we use the \(\mu\)-calculus to define degrees of ignorance on Epistemic Logic and study the implications of \(\mu\)-calculus's collapse over the logics above. This is joint work with Kazuyuki Tanaka. <a href="./slides/slides-wollic2022.pdf">Slides.</a>

			</summary>
			<p>
				It is well-known that several variations of the axiom of determinacy play important roles in the study of reverse mathematics, and the relation between the hierarchy of determinacy (especially the level of \(\Sigma^0_2\) and \(\Sigma^0_3\)) and comprehension axioms are revealed by Tanaka, Nemoto, Montalb√°n, Shore, and others. In this talk, we show variations of a result by Ko≈Çodziejczyk and Michalewski relating determinacy and reflection in second-order arithmetic based on a model-theoretic characterization of the reflection principles.

				Abstract: It is known that several variations of the axiom of determinacy play important roles in the study of reverse mathematics, and the relation between the hierarchy of determinacy and comprehension are revealed by Tanaka, Nemoto, Montalb√°n, Shore, and others. We prove variations of a result by Ko≈Çodziejczyk and Michalewski relating determinacy of arbitrary boolean combinations of \(\Sigma^0_2\) sets and reflection in second-order arithmetic. Specifically, we prove that: over \(\mathsf{ACA}_0\), \(\Pi^1_2\)-\(\mathsf{Ref}(\mathsf{ACA}_0)\) is equivalent to \(\forall n.(\Sigma^0_1)_n\)-\(\mathsf{Det}^*_0\); \(\Pi^1_3\)-\(\mathsf{Ref}(\Pi^1_1\)-\(\mathsf{CA}_0)\) is equivalent to \(\forall n.(\Sigma^0_1)_n\)-\(\mathsf{Det}\); and \(\Pi^1_3\)-\(\mathsf{Ref}(\Pi^1_2\)-\(\mathsf{CA}_0)\) is equivalent to \(\forall n.(\Sigma^0_2)_n\)-\(\mathsf{Det}\). We also restate results by Montalb√°n and Shore to show that \(\Pi^1_3\)-\(\mathsf{Ref}(\mathsf{Z}_2)\) is equivalent to \(\forall n.(\Sigma^0_3)_n\)-\(\mathsf{Det}\) over \(\mathsf{ACA}_0\).

				Abstract: It is known that the \(\mu\)-calculus collapses to its alternation-free fragment over transitive frames and to modal logic over equivalence relations.
    			We adapt a proof by D'Agostino and Lenzi to show that the \(\mu\)-calculus collapses to its alternation-free fragment over weakly transitive frames.
    			As a consequence, we show that the \(\mu\)-calculus with derivative topological semantics collapses to its alternation-free fragment.
    			We also study the collapse over frames of \(\mathsf{S4.2}\), \(\mathsf{S4.3}\), \(\mathsf{S4.3.2}\), \(\mathsf{S4.4}\) and \(\mathsf{KD45}\), logics important for Epistemic Logic.
    			At last, we use the \(\mu\)-calculus to define degrees of ignorance on Epistemic Logic and study the implications of \(\mu\)-calculus's collapse over the logics above.

			</summary>
			<p>
				Abstract: In this paper, we study one-variable fragments of modal \(\mu\)-calculus and their relations to parity games.
				We first introduce the weak modal \(\mu\)-calculus as an extension of the one-variable modal \(\mu\)-calculus.
				We apply weak parity games to show the strictness of the one-variable hierarchy as well as its extension.
				We also consider games with infinitely many priorities and show that their winning positions can be expressed by both \(\Sigma^\mu_2\) and \(\Pi^\mu_2\) formulas with two variables, but requires a transfinite extension of the \(L_\mu\)-formulas to be expressed with only one variable.
				At last, we define the \(\mu\)-arithmetic and show that a set of natural numbers is definable by both a \(\Sigma^\mu_2\) and a \(\Pi^\mu_2\) formula of \(\mu\)-arithmetic if and only if it is definable by a formula of the one-variable transfinite \(\mu\)-arithmetic.

				<summary>Thesis: Exploring the difference hierarchies on \(\mu\)-calculus and arithmetic ‚Äî from the point of view of Gale‚ÄìStewart games</summary>

				<p>Available <a href="./phd_thesis-Leonardo.pdf">here</a>.</p>

				<p>Short abstract: In this thesis, we study two problems related to difference hierarchies.
				The difference hierarchy for a point class \(\Gamma\) classifies the Boolean combinations of sets in \(\Gamma\) by their complexity.
				Gale‚ÄìStewart games play essential roles in both problems.</p>

				<p>In the first part of this thesis, we study the \(\mu\)-calculus' alternation hierarchy over various semantics.
				The \(\mu\)-calculus' alternation hierarchy classifies its formulas by how many interdependent fixed-point operators appear in a given formula.
				Bradfield showed that the alternation hierarchy is strict over arbitrary frames.
				This may not happen if we modify the semantics.</p>

				<p>We refine Alberucci and Facchini's proof of the collapse to modal logic over equivalence relations to show that the alternation hierarchy collapses to modal logic in bigger classes of frames.
				We use this characterization to study degrees of ignorance in various epistemic logics.
				Afterwards, we show that, on graded semantics, constructive semantics and modal logic with impossible worlds, the alternation hierarchy collapses to modal logic over equivalence relations.
				On the other hand, the alternation hierarchy is strict on multimodal \(\mu\)-calculus over equivalence relations.
				We also show that current proofs of the collapse do not work on the non-monotone \(\mu\)-calculus.
				Furthermore, we show that the alternation hierarchy collapses to its alternation-free fragment over weakly transitive frames.</p>

				<p>In the second part of this thesis, we study the connection between Gale‚ÄìStewart games and reflection principles in second-order arithmetic.
				Gale‚ÄìStewart games have been studied in reverse mathematics since its beginning and are central to descriptive set theory.
				Sets definable by the \(\mu\)-calculus are exactly the winning regions of Gale‚ÄìStewart games whose payoffs are Boolean combinations of \(\Sigma^0_2\) sets.</p>

				<p>Ko≈Çodziejczyk and Michalewski proved that the determinacy of Boolean combinations of \(\Sigma^0_2\) sets is equivalent to the reflection principle \(\Pi^1_3\)-\(\mathrm{Ref}(\Pi^1_2\)-\(\mathsf{CA}_0)\).
				We use finite sequences of coded \(\beta\)-models to prove that the determinacy of Boolean combinations of \(\Sigma^0_1\) sets is equivalent to the reflection principle \(\Pi^1_3\)-\(\mathrm{Ref}(\Pi^1_1\)-\(\mathsf{CA}_0)\).
				We also use the same method to give a new proof of Ko≈Çodziejczyk and Michalewski's result.
				At last, we use a modified version of the method to prove that the determinacy of Boolean combinations of \(\Sigma^0_1\) sets of Cantor space is equivalent to the reflection principle \(\Pi^1_2\)-\(\mathrm{Ref}(\mathsf{ACA}_0)\).</p>
