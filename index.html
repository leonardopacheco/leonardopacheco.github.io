				"Determinacy and reflection principles in second-order arithmetic"at <a href="https://wrmp2022.sciencesconf.org">Workshop on Reverse Mathematics and its Philosophy</a> (joint presentation with Keita Yokoyama)
			</summary>
			<p>
				It is well-known that several variations of the axiom of determinacy play important roles in the study of reverse mathematics, and the relation between the hierarchy of determinacy (especially the level of \(\Sigma^0_2\) and \(\Sigma^0_3\)) and comprehension axioms are revealed by Tanaka, Nemoto, Montalbán, Shore, and others. In this talk, we show variations of a result by Kołodziejczyk and Michalewski relating determinacy and reflection in second-order arithmetic based on a model-theoretic characterization of the reflection principles.

				"Determinacy and reflection principles in second-order arithmetic" at <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/jp-ru-logic2022/">The second Japan-Russia workshop on effective descriptive set theory, computable analysis and automata</a>
			</summary>
			<p>
				Working in second order arithmetic, we characterize determinacy of finite differences of open and \(\Sigma^0_2\) sets as reflection principles. In order to do so we study sequences of coded \(\beta\)-models. More precisely, we prove that: over \(\mathsf{ACA}_0\), \(\Pi^1_2\)-\(\mathsf{Ref}(\mathsf{ACA}_0)\) is equivalent to \(\forall n.(\Sigma^0_1)_n\)-\(\mathsf{Det}^*_0\), and \(\Pi^1_3\)-\(\mathsf{Ref}(\Pi^1_1\)-\(\mathsf{CA}_0)\) is equivalent to \(\forall n.(\Sigma^0_1)_n\)-\(\mathsf{Det}\); over \(\mathsf{ATR}_0\), \(\Pi^1_3\)-\(\mathsf{Ref}(\Pi^1_2\)-\(\mathsf{CA}_0)\) is equivalent to \(\forall n.(\Sigma^0_2)_n\)-\(\mathsf{Det}\). This is joint work with Keita Yokoyama.

			</summary>
			<p>
				 We study the reflection axioms of the form: if a \(\Pi^1_n\) sentence \(\varphi\) is provable in \(T\), then \(\varphi\) is true (for a fixed theory \(T\)). We prove the relation between the existence of sequence of \(\beta_k\) models and reflection axioms for theories of dependent choices. We also comment on the consequences of these results for determinacy in second-order arithmetic. This is a joint work with Keita Yokoyama.

			</summary>
			<p>
				Epistemic logic is the logic of knowledge, belief and related notions. In this presentation I define and motivate three different modal semantics for epistemic logic: relational semantics, topological semantics and neighborhood semantics. I also comment on the relation between these semantics and common knowledge. I assume no knowledge of modal logic.
