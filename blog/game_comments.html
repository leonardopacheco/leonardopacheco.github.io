    <p>I comment on games I’ve been playing recently here. Most of them are JRPGs, but I also play other genres. Comments mostly spoiler free. Sometimes I also talk about games on <a rel="me" href="https://mathstodon.xyz/@leonardopacheco">Mastodon</a>.</p>

        <summary>Dark Souls (2011) -new-</summary>
        <p>First tried playing it on PC a long time ago, but it didn't click. (Maybe I went up to the second boss, but I don't think I beat it.) Gave it another try after watching quite a few speedruns, watching a roommate beat Bloodborne and Sekiro, and playing a few soulslike myself. The second time was pretty great.</p>

        <p>I used a pyromancer, and the melee/magic balance made it pretty fun. I liked the first half of the game much more than the second. (Lost Izalith and New Londo Ruins felt pretty meh.) The difficulty was not that bad with some patience and the online wikis. As I played the PS3 version, the servers were working, but mostly empty; that is, I played it mostly offline.</p>

        <p>Overall, it was good to give it another chance. I'll probably try Bloodborne or Elden Rings in the future. (Even if I play them 11 years late.)</p>

        <summary>The Legend of Zelda: Wind Waker (2002) -new-</summary>
        <p>Played on the Game Cube on 2021. Was a pretty good 3D Zelda game. Only the stealth section was a little bit too annoying. Also, the sailing was a bit slow, but I've heard that it got faster on the HD remakes.</p>

        <summary>Mega Man Zero/ZX Legacy Collection (2002–2007)</summary>
        <p>Lots of memories about these. I used to play Zero 4 and Zero 3 when I was a kid. I was also very bad at these games. At that time, I really wanted to play ZX, but never was able to. It was pretty good to play the whole series.</p>

        <p>This collection would be my recommendation for anyone who wants to play these games. The killer feature is the new accessibility features. You can turn on checkpoints throughout the games and turn on a casual model. The checkpoints help with the tricky parts; the original life system is quite bad, and even worse in Zero 1. I didn't use the casual mode, but it should be helpful to check the story without suffering the difficulty. (The story from Zero 1 to Zero 4 is pretty nice.)</p>

        <p>For me, the main part of this collection is the Zero games. The first one is quite rough-edged, but they get better. While building on the Mega Man X series, previous knowledge is not necessary. Everything you need to know is explained in game. With the checkpoints, the game has a nice balance of platforming and boss fighting. In general, I enjoyed these way more than I did when I was a kid.</p>

        <p>On the other hand, the ZX are extremely okay. The maps are confusing, they focus more on the buster than on the saber, and the story is not bad, I guess. Maybe a remake/sequel combo to polish it up and close up the story would be a good game. Play these once to see the potential and then go back to the Zero games to have fun.</p>

        <p>At last, I'd recommend not using the Switch joycon's analog sticks. Way to much action to risk breaking them.</p>

        <summary>Moon: remix RPG adventure (1997)</summary>
        <p> Started playing Moon this week on my Switch. Pretty quirky game, the writing and character design is just great. Unfortunately it is a little too slow for my head to handle. A few qualities of life would have made it perfect (at least fast-forwarding would be pretty useful for experimenting). It is quite an experience, if you are in the right mindset. I've heard that it inspired Undertale.</p>

        <summary>Shin Megami Tensei V (2021)</summary>
        <p> I decided to buy my switch when this was announced a few years ago. It fulfilled my quite high expectations. It’s a quite solid dungeon crawler with an okay story. While it’s story is a little bit sparse, it’s main beats hit hard. One could say it is a more modern take on SMT3.  You travel through a post-apocalyptic Tokyo, can befriend demons (maybe a not good choice for the english translation), and things happen.</p>

        <p> The demons are based on creatures/gods of many real world religions. While they include many from christian mythology, most are from other religions (the shinto god which names the shrine near my home was in SMT4). The main character can befriend and fuse them. You actually need to convince/bribe demons to have new partners, so it’s not just a random throw, and each one has a different approach. Also the main character has a nice hair.</p>

        <p>The battle system is the same since SMT3, each party member gets a turn, and gets one more for hitting an effective move; while the same holds for you enemies. My build choice was a mix of physical attack, with some support moves; I got my demons to have magics and other support skills. I still need to play the New Game+ to get the ending I actually wanted.</p>

        <summary>Sword and Fairy: Together Forever (2021) -new-</summary>
        <p>This is the worst videogame translation I've seen in a long time. The combat is fun, but there are so many badly translated cutscenes that the games feels like a slog. May be better if you are fluent in Mandarin. (Spoilers from TV Tropes make it look like a good story.)</p>

        <summary>Trails in the Sky (2004, 2006, 2007)</summary>
        <p> I'd heard these games have a lot of text, so I wasn't expecting much. It <strong>does</strong> have a lot of text. Sometimes I spent one or two hours just reading text. But the story is well paced (maybe slow, depending on one's taste), and develops the characters throughly. One of the best stories in the RPGs I've played before, and I'm looking for the next games.</p>

        <p>On the gameplay, it's a fine strategy RPG (think of Final Fantasy Tatics). The part that I thought the best was that it has many character, and all which are actually used in the games. In the first two you have a limited choice most of the time, but on the third there are 16 characters when everyone is unlocked. There are good opportunities to use all of them. The difficulty is also balanced, with easier and harder options. Also, the experience rate is really good for low level characters, and so it is easy to try other party configurations.</p>

        <p>Bonus: I played the PS3 versions, which are ports of PSP games and have lovely names:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>英雄伝説 空の軌跡FC：改 HD EDITION,</li>
            <li>英雄伝説 空の軌跡SC：改 HD EDITION, and</li>
            <li>英雄伝説 空の軌跡 the 3rd：改 HD EDITION.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Because: the Trails series is a subseries of the Legend of Heroes Series (which is a spinoff of the Dragon Slayer series. Read more <a href="https://huguesjohnson.com/features/american-falcom/">here</a>); it has three chapters: First Chapter, Second Chapter, and the 3rd; and it is an improved (改) HD edition. Also note that each Chapter is also divided into chapters again.</p>

        <summary>Trails from the Zero, Trails to Azure (2010, 2011)</summary>
        <p>The second arc of the best RPG series you are not going to play. Wonderful story, but very slow burning: you need to play the Sky sub-series, or the story will make little sense. Zero has one of the best character developments I've ever seen (building up on SC and 3rd).</p>

        <p>The gameplay builds up on the previous games, but the cast here is quite smaller. This is a nice change of pace after the enormous cast of 3rd.</p>

        <p>Overall score: 10/10, wouldn't recommend.</p>

        <summary>Undertale (2015)</summary>
        <p>Undertale is probably the most emotional games I’ve ever played. If you like story games (with a few action(?)/RPG elements), just play it. Better enjoyed spoiler-free.</p>

        <summary>Yoku's Island Express (2018) -new-</summary>
        <p>Nice little metroidvania with pinball mechanics. Has some nice challenges but plenty of checkpoints; very relaxing overall. Using pinball for exploration was very fun. The game is long enough to get a good fell of the controls, but not too long to get boring. </p>
