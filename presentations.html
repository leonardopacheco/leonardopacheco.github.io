        <p>
            Feedback Turing machines are Turing machines which can query a halting oracle which has information on the convergence or divergence of feedback computations. To avoid a contradiction by diagonalization, feedback Turing machines have two ways of not converging: they can diverge as standard Turing machines, or they can freeze. A natural question to ask is: what about feedback Turing machines which can ask if computations of the same type converge, diverge, or freeze? We define \(\alpha\)th order feedback Turing machines for each computable ordinal \(\alpha\). We also describe feedback computable and semi-computable sets using inductive definitions and Gale–Stewart games.

        </summary>

        <p>
            The modal \(\mu\)-calculus is obtained by adding least and greatest fixed-point operators to modal logic. It's alternation hierarchy classifies the \(\mu\)-formulas by their alternation depth: a measure of the codependence of their least and greatest fixed-point operators. The \(\mu\)-calculus' alternation hierarchy is strict over the class of all Kripke frames: for all \(n\), there is a \(\mu\)-formula with alternation depth \(n+1\) which is not equivalent to any formula with alternation depth \(n\). This does not always happen if we restrict the semantics. For example, every \(\mu\)-formula is equivalent to a formula without fixed-point operators over \(\mathsf{S5}\) frames. We show that the multimodal \(\mu\)-calculus' alternation hierarchy is strict over non-trivial fusions of modal logics. We also comment on two examples of multimodal logics where the \(\mu\)-calculus collapses to modal logic.

        </summary>

        <p>
            Artemov and Protopopescu defined an intuitionistic epistemic logic IEL to reason about intuitionistic knowledge. While classical knowledge implies classical truth, intuitionistic truth implies intuitionistic knowledge. We describe Artemov and Protopopescu's IEL and its BHK interpretation. We characterize epistemic possibility in IEL.

        </summary>

        <p>
            I will talk about the connection between reflection principles and the existence of sequences of beta-models in second-order arithmetic. The reflection principles are of the form: if a formula is provable in a given system, then they are true. Beta-models are coded models which have the same ordinals as the ground model. I comment on how to use this connection to characterize determinacy axioms in reverse mathematics.

        </summary>

        <p>
            We define a constructive version of the \(\mu\)-calculus by adding least and greatest fixed-point operators to constructive modal logic. We define game semantics for the constructive \(\mu\)-calculus and prove its equivalence to bi-relational Kripke semantics. For applications, we study the logic \(\mu\mathsf{CS5}\), a constructive variation of \(\mathsf{S5}\) with fixed-points operators.

        </summary>
        <p>The \(\mu\)-calculus is obtained by adding least and greatest fixed-point operators \(\mu\) and \(\nu\) to modal logic. The alternation depth of a formula measures the entanglement of its least and greatest fixed-point operators. Bradfield showed that, for all \(n\in\mathbb{N}\), there is a formula \(W_n\) such that \(W_n\) has alternation depth \(n\) and, over all Kripke frames, \(W_n\) is not equivalent to any formula with alternation depth smaller than \(n\).</p>

        <p>The same may not happen over restricted classes of frames: Alberucci and Facchini showed that, the \(\mu\)-calculus collapses to modal logic over \(\mathsf{S5}\) frames. That is, every \(\mu\)-formula is equivalent to a formula without fixed point operators over \(\mathsf{S5}\) frames. Later, Pacheco and Tanaka proved that the \(\mu\)-calculus also collapses to the \(\mu\)-calculus over \(\mathsf{S4.4}\) and \(\mathsf{S4.3.2}\) frames. </p>

        <p>We show how Alberucci and Facchini's proof generalize to the \(\mu\)-calculus's collapse over \(n\)-pigeonhole frames. Let \(n\in\omega\). A frame \(F =\langle W,R\rangle\) is an \(n\)-pigeonhole frame iff, for all sequence \(w_0 R^+ w_1 R^+ \cdots R^+ w_n\), there is \(i< j\leq n\) such that \(w_{i}R =  w_{j}R\). We also comment about ongoing work to prove the converse: if the \(\mu\)-calculus collapses to modal logic over a class of frames \(\mathsf{F}\), then there is \(n\in\omega\) such all frames \(F\in\mathsf{F}\) are \(n\)-pigeonhole. </p>

        <p>
            The \(\mu\)-calculus is obtained by adding to modal logic the least and greatest fixed-point operators \(\mu\) and \(\nu\). The alternation depth of a formula measures the entanglement of its least and greatest fixed-point operators.

        <p>
            The same may not happen over restricted classes of frames: Alberucci and Facchini showed that, over frames of \(\mathsf{S5}\), every \(\mu\)-formula is equivalent to a formula without fixed point operators. In this case, we say the \(\mu\)-calculus collapses to modal logic over frames of \(\mathsf{S5}\).
        <p>
            We show how Alberucci and Facchini’s proof generalize to the \(\mu\)-calculus’s collapse over frames of intuitionistic \(\mathsf{S5}\). This generalization can also be done for some non-normal logics and for graded modal logics. We also show that, on the other hand, the \(\mu\)-calculus does not collapse over the bimodal logic \(\mathsf{S5}_2\).

        </summary>
        <p>
            The \(\mu\)-calculus is obtained by adding fixed-point operators to modal logic. Alberucci and Facchini showed that every \(\mu\)-formula is equivalent to some modal formula over frames of \(\mathsf{S5}\). The modal logic \(\mathsf{IS5}\) is an intuitionistic variation of \(\mathsf{S5}\), first defined by Prior in 1957. We show that, with slight changes, Alberucci and Facchini's proof also works in frames of \(\mathsf{IS5}\). That is, every \(\mu\)-formula is equivalent to some modal formula over frames of \(\mathsf{IS5}\). This is joint work with Kazuyuki Tanaka. <a href="./slides/akiu-2022.pdf">Slides.</a>

        </summary>
        <p>
            It is known that the \(\mu\)-calculus collapses to its alternation-free fragment over transitive frames and to modal logic over equivalence relations.
            We adapt a proof by D'Agostino and Lenzi to show that the \(\mu\)-calculus collapses to its alternation-free fragment over weakly transitive frames.
            As a consequence, we show that the \(\mu\)-calculus with derivative topological semantics collapses to its alternation-free fragment.
            We also study the collapse over frames of \(\mathsf{S4.2}\), \(\mathsf{S4.3}\), \(\mathsf{S4.3.2}\), \(\mathsf{S4.4}\) and \(\mathsf{KD45}\), logics important for Epistemic Logic.
            At last, we use the \(\mu\)-calculus to define degrees of ignorance on Epistemic Logic and study the implications of \(\mu\)-calculus's collapse over the logics above. This is joint work with Kazuyuki Tanaka. <a href="./slides/slides-wollic2022.pdf">Slides.</a>

        </summary>
        <p>
            It is well-known that several variations of the axiom of determinacy play important roles in the study of reverse mathematics, and the relation between the hierarchy of determinacy (especially the level of \(\Sigma^0_2\) and \(\Sigma^0_3\)) and comprehension axioms are revealed by Tanaka, Nemoto, Montalbán, Shore, and others. In this talk, we show variations of a result by Kołodziejczyk and Michalewski relating determinacy and reflection in second-order arithmetic based on a model-theoretic characterization of the reflection principles.

        <p>
            Working in second order arithmetic, we characterize determinacy of finite differences of open and \(\Sigma^0_2\) sets as reflection principles. In order to do so we study sequences of coded \(\beta\)-models. More precisely, we prove that: over \(\mathsf{ACA}_0\), \(\Pi^1_2\)-\(\mathsf{Ref}(\mathsf{ACA}_0)\) is equivalent to \(\forall n.(\Sigma^0_1)_n\)-\(\mathsf{Det}^*_0\), and \(\Pi^1_3\)-\(\mathsf{Ref}(\Pi^1_1\)-\(\mathsf{CA}_0)\) is equivalent to \(\forall n.(\Sigma^0_1)_n\)-\(\mathsf{Det}\); over \(\mathsf{ATR}_0\), \(\Pi^1_3\)-\(\mathsf{Ref}(\Pi^1_2\)-\(\mathsf{CA}_0)\) is equivalent to \(\forall n.(\Sigma^0_2)_n\)-\(\mathsf{Det}\).

        <p>
            Epistemic logic is the logic of knowledge, belief and related notions. In this presentation I define and motivate three different modal semantics for epistemic logic: relational semantics, topological semantics and neighborhood semantics. I also comment on the relation between these semantics and common knowledge. I assume no knowledge of modal logic.
